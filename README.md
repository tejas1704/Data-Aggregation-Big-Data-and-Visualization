# Data Aggregation, Big Data and Visualization using Hadoop, MapReduce and d3.js

This project involves,  
(i) Data aggregation from more than one source(Twitter and NYTimes) using the APIs exposed by data sources  
(ii) Applying classical big data analytic method of MapReduce to the unstructured data collected  
      - Code and execute MapReduce word count on each of the data sets  
      - Mapper will clean and parse the data sets into words, remove stop words
      - Reducer will count the useful words  
(iii) Building a visualization data product using d3.js.
